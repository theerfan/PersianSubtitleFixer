# PersianSubtitleFixer (for windows)
Fixes encoding problems for your persian (or any other utf-8) subtitles. Enjoy watching!

Just run the PersianSubtitleFixer\bin\Debug\PersianSubtitleFixer.exe file to see the magic. 
A bunch of MS Word documents will pop up but don't worry, they'll close themselves in a second.
You can easily give your desired addresses to the program by drag-and-dropping your files and folders into the console.
Enjoy! :))
